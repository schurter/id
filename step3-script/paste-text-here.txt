This will be my tagline: Responsive Web Development Made Simply

This will be my introductory text, a paragraph(s) totalling at least 150 words that welcome user, state the goal of the portfolio website, and describe my ambitions and something positive I feel about working in web: Hello! My name is Grant Rossi. I am a student at Pittsburgh Technical College currently pursuing my Associate in Science Degree with a Concentration in Web Design and Development. Ever since high school, I have been interested in the sites that we use on a day to day basis. I began my education in 9th grade and knew I wanted this to become my career. I am proficient in HTML5, CSS, SASS, JavaScript and have working skills in MySQL and PHP. I enjoy working with motivated people that are excited to create a new product for the client. Design and development are elements that surrounds us every day and it is important to make sure that when creating a new product, it is functional, accessible, and engaging. In my portfolio below, I have prepared multiple projects that I have worked on in the past few years that demonstrate responsiveness, functionality, and a good design sense.

Here is a piece description for one piece that my portfolio will show, following the format outlined on Blackboard:
Title & Type of Site: Steel Incline Reality
Talent Showcased: Responsive Layout, Front-end Development
Objective: Give users the ability to find pricing for housing within the Pittsburgh area
Target Audience: Young adults, adults
Highlights:
1) A grid layout was chosen as it allowed users to compare and contrast multiple housing locations at the same time.
2) The palette and imagery are opulent and bold, catering to an adult target audience.
3) MySQL query language allows the site administration create and delete job postings as necessary.
4) The Pittsburgh Incline’s “incline” is repeatedly throughout the site such as in the buttons inside of the listings.
