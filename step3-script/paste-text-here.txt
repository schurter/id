This will be my tagline:
Beautiful creative solutions

Hello, my name is Madeline Subetto and I’m very confident in the work that I’ve done in the past 2 years. I’v been working with the web for 4 years. I went to Pittsburgh Technical College to achieve my Associate in Science Degree in Multimedia Technologies with Concentration in Web Design and Development. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PhP, and MySQL. I’m also knowledgeable in Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, DreamWeaver and all Microsoft office platforms. Even with the web world changing so fast I feel that I can keep up well and learn quickly. Coding is a passion of mine and I look forward to furthering my knowledge.
