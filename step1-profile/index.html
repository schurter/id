  <h2>Graphics</h2>
  <p>What kind of graphics, images, shapes, or icons will help associate you with the skills, a job, or branding concept? Having a curved or straight line that moves freely throughtout my picture I feel would show I am willing to hear other people's ideas or that i am a straight forward person.
