  <h1>Logo/Identity PROFILE</h1>

  <h2>Job Title</h2>
  <p>What position are you seeking? Front End Designer</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>
  <p>What association do you want people to have when they think of you? Forward Thinking, Creative and Quality</p>

  <h2>Skill Sets</h2>
  <p>What skill sets are you looking to promote? Traditonal Design, Layout/User Interface Design and Creative Problem Solving.</p>

  <h2>Colors</h2>
  <p>What colors are you thinking about for your “brand”?  Limit to 2 or 3 colors.  If you need more, write about the reasons. Black and White. My last name is White, so i am basing the design off that. Keep it Simple.</p>

  <h2>Graphics</h2>
  <p>What kind of graphics, images, shapes, or icons will help associate you with the skills, a job, or branding concept? A timeless design will help stand the test of time. A modern design will also help with todays market trends. Many of the designs will use basic shapes and abstract shapes. If the shape stays abstract then the logo should stay timeless.</p>

  <h2>Shape Ideas</h2>
  <p>What will be the overall “background” shape of your identity mark, if any? Square, Circle, Rectangle…? It depends on the typography and what will compliment the design. In the designs I currently have, i have used a square and rectangle.</p>
